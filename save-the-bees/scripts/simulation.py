'''
	This script will be the main script for creating 
	executable commands for the simulation of CCD
	
	The main library I will be using will be SimPy, a 'discrete event simulation'
	for Python. There will also be an example simulation script in this 
	scripts directory that will not be routed to the main functionality of this 
	project.
